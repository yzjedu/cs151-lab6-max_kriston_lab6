The objective of this program was to make an interactive atm that we can use to alter the balance present in the atm.
We were supposed to accomplish error checking user inputs, defining functions, invoking functions, and manipulating variables in and out of functions. 


The steps we followed to develop this code was using the code solution to understand how to refactor the code using functions, refactoring the code using functions, and changing the error checking functions previously present.

Our results matched what we expected to get, we tried various test cases to ensure our function continues running unless it's asked not to.
We tried test cases on every end of the equation. 

The challenges we encountered was using variables in and out of the functions. 
We were able to overcome them by trying different options and ways to manipulate variables.
I liked working with Max.
